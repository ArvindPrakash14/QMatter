The QPG6105 and QPG7015M included in the kit operate as the Matter device (e.g. Light bulb) and the Matter hub (Border
Router) respectively offering the user an easy-to-use environment to explore Matter as well as other IoT standards.
Setting up the reference applications is a matter of minutes. With Thread, Bluetooth Low Energy and Zigbee connectivity
installed on the gateway side, this kit is ideal for evaluating Qorvo ConcurrentConnect&trade; technology
differentiators and prototyping your custom IoT applications. The kit is your one-stop-shop for developing applications
on both the gateway and the device side.
