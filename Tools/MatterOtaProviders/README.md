# Matter&trade; OTA Providers

This folder contains executables of Matter OTA Providers. These allow you to set up a node in the Matter network that
can host Over-The-Air (OTA) upgrade files. This node can be polled by any other Matter node in the network to understand
if a newer upgrade image is available. Matter OTA Providers are delivered for two types of platforms:
* [Raspberry Pi 4+ with Ubuntu 20.04 or newer](RPi)
* [x64_linux with Ubuntu 20.04 or newer](x64_linux)

Step-by-Step guide how to use the Matter OTA Provider and perform an OTA download over Matter, can be found
[here](../../Documents/Guides/ota_device_firmware_upgrade.md).
